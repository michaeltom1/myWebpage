# MyWebpage

A personal portfolio website built with React, Vite and Tailwind CSS. This repository contains the source for a modern, responsive portfolio showcasing projects, services, and contact information. The site includes progressive enhancements such as a service worker for offline fallback, animated UI elements, and a mobile-friendly navigation experience.

## Key features

- Modern, glassmorphism-inspired UI with animated backgrounds and subtle motion.

## Tech stack

- React 18

## Repository structure (important files)

- `index.html` — app shell

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node.js (16+) and npm.

## Service worker & offline behavior

- A lightweight service worker is included at `public/service-worker.js`. It precaches the app shell (`/` and `/offline.html`) and performs simple runtime caching for other assets.

## Contributing

Small fixes and documentation improvements are welcome. For code changes:

## Troubleshooting

- If the site fails to build, check the terminal output for missing dependencies or syntax errors.

## License
